# Desperate Times - Backend

We recommend you use this alongside our [getting started walkthrough](https://keystonejs.com/docs/walkthroughs/getting-started-with-create-keystone-app) which will walk you through what you get as part of this starter.

If you want an overview of all the features Keystone offers, check out our [features](https://keystonejs.com/why-keystone#features) page.

## Some Quick Notes On Getting Started

### Auth

We've put auth into its own file to make this humble starter easier to navigate. To explore it without auth turned on, comment out the `isAccessAllowed` on line 21 of the Keystone file [./keystone.ts](./keystone.ts).

For more on auth, check out our [Authentication API Docs](https://keystonejs.com/docs/apis/auth#authentication-api)

### Adding a frontend

A walkthrough on how to do this is forthcoming, but in the meantime our [todo example](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-react-todo-demo) shows a Keystone set up with a frontend. For a more full example, you can also look at an example app we built for [Prisma Day 2021](https://github.com/keystonejs/prisma-day-2021-workshop)

### Embedding Keystone in a Next.js frontend

While Keystone works as a standalone app, you can embed your Keystone app into a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app. This is quite a different setup to the starter, and we recommend checking out our walkthrough for that [here](https://keystonejs.com/docs/walkthroughs/embedded-mode-with-sqlite-nextjs#how-to-embed-keystone-sq-lite-in-a-next-js-app).
